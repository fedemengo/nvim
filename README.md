Nvim config in fennel (lisp). Once completed this should replace [fedemengo/.dotfiles/.config/nvim](https://github.com/fedemengo/.dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim) as submodule

## TODOs

Move as many mappings as possible into which-key

## Requirements

- [fennel](https://fennel-lang.org)

## Bootstrap

Install required plugins with `:PackerInstall`, that's it
